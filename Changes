Revision history for Perl extension Date::Components.

0.0.1  Sat Oct 20 22:59:57 2007
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-XAn Date::Components
        - The version above, 0.0.1, was manually changed from the automatically
          generated version, 0.01.  This conforms to Perl Best Practices.


0.0.2  Wed Nov 28 18:49:37 CST 2007
	- Previous version did not have reference to Test::Manifest and thus
          failed virtually all tests by CPAN testers.  It is now included
          in the Makefile.PL file.  Dependencies were also added for these two
          POD modules, Test::Pod and Test::Pod::Coverage.


0.1.0  Fri Dec 28 15:42:55 CST 2007
	- New subroutine, 'date_offset_in_weekdays', was added.
        - Subroutine, 'get_numeric_day_of_week', is now overloaded to accept
          a date string as input along with the original list of date
          components.
        - Subroutine, 'format_date', was modified so that unrecognized formats
          are now treated as invalid inputs and an exception is thrown.
          Previously, unrecognized date format options returned the default
          date format.
